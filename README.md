# Honeydew Grocery List

Honeydew is a simple grocery list designed for families and available for Android, Alex, and Google Assistant.

## Honeydew for Google Assistant

This is the Google Assistant app for Honeydew. I don't have time to maintain it, so I'm giving it to the world for free.

## Other Honeydew components

You can build the app, but it won't be super interesting on its own. The real magic is in the syncing with other devices and services, which require other components:
